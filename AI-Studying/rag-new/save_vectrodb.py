# Task 6: Save Vector Database to File

# Let's make our vector database persistent! The save script will:

# Create sample documents - Add 4 TechCorp policy documents to the collection
# Persist the database to disk - Use ChromaDB's built-in persistence at ./chroma_db
# Export to JSON file - Save all documents and metadata to vectordb_backup.json
# Verify file creation - Check file size and confirm successful save
# Show persistence benefits - Data survives restarts, can be shared between apps
# Save the vector database to a file for persistence:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
