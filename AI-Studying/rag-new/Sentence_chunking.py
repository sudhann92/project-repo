# Task 6: Sentence-Aware Chunking

# 📄 View the script - sentence_chunking.py to see how it works

# What this demo shows:
# This script demonstrates advanced chunking using spaCy for sentence-aware text splitting. It compares basic character-based chunking with intelligent sentence-boundary chunking, showing how breaking at natural language boundaries improves semantic coherence.

# What you'll see:

# Basic character-based chunking (may break mid-sentence)
# spaCy-powered sentence-aware chunking
# Side-by-side comparison of chunk quality
# Analysis of sentence boundary preservation
# Benefits of natural language processing for chunking
# Run the sentence-aware chunking demo:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

TechCorp Security Policy and Remote Work Guidelines

Employees working remotely must follow strict security protocols to protect company data and systems. All remote work must be conducted using company-approved devices and software, including laptops, monitors, and security software. Personal devices, including smartphones and tablets, are strictly prohibited for accessing company systems or storing confidential information.

The company provides VPN access to all remote employees, which must be used whenever accessing internal systems or databases. VPN connections must be established before accessing any company resources, and employees must ensure their internet connection is secure and private. Public Wi-Fi networks, including those in coffee shops, airports, and hotels, are not permitted for company work due to security risks.

All confidential documents must be stored in approved cloud storage systems with proper encryption and access controls. Local storage of sensitive information on personal computers or external drives is strictly forbidden. Employees must use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for all company accounts and systems.

Regular security training sessions are mandatory for all remote workers, covering topics such as phishing prevention, password management, and data handling procedures. Employees must complete these training modules within 30 days of starting remote work and annually thereafter. Failure to complete security training may result in suspension of remote work privileges.

Incident reporting procedures require immediate notification of any security breaches, suspicious activities, or potential data exposures to the IT security team. Employees must report incidents within 2 hours of discovery using the designated security hotline or email system. Delayed reporting may result in disciplinary action and potential legal consequences.
