Vulnerability Description
The "TNS Listener Poison Attack" affects the Oracle Database Server. This vulnerability may be remotely exploitable over a network without the need for a username and password. A remote user can exploit this vulnerability to impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems. 

Solution
TNS Poison Attack vulnerability is mitigated through enabling Valid Node Checking Registration (VNCR) setting, which permits service registration from only known nodes or IPs. The steps to enable Valid Node Checking Registration (VNCR) setting can be found below: 

 

Step 1:  

Identify the listener_name which can be found in listener.ora file located in the "$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin" directory on the server. 
Step 2: 

Add the below entry into listener.ora file as shown below. And fill in the default values with appropriate values for your instance. 

 



#File Begins from here 
LISTENER = // The listener_name is by default - "LISTENER". 
 
(DESCRIPTION_LIST = 
 
  (DESCRIPTION = 
 
     (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1)) 
 
     (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = myserver.example.com)(PORT = [PORT])) 
 
  ) 
 
) 
#File Ends here 


VALID_NODE_CHECKING_REGISTRATION_listener_name = ON //Append line with actual listener name identified in Step 1 

 

Step 3:  

Type lsnrctl in command line. 

[root@test ~]# lsnrctl 
And then the following commands. 

LSNRCTL>set current_listener listener_name  
 
LSNRCTL>stop 
 
LSNRCTL>start


Disclaimer
This cookbook is a solution proposal and has been proven to work on some Nordea applications, but every system is built differently so it's possible that there are better solutions or compatibility issues for your specific application context. Remember to always verify the remediation through your software testing procedures and never patch the production environment without testing on development/preprod/staging environments first and confirming proper recovery options.
